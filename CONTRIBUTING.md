   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/kmrl-fleet-management-dashboard.git
   cd kmrl-fleet-management-dashboard
   ```

### Branch Naming Convention
- `feature/description` - New features
- `fix/description` - Bug fixes
- `docs/description` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/description` - Code refactoring
- `test/description` - Adding tests

Example: `feature/mobile-navigation` or `fix/table-responsive-layout`

## üìù Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript & React
- **Use TypeScript** for all new code
- **Functional components** with hooks
- **Proper type definitions** for props and state
- **Meaningful component names** (PascalCase)
- **Custom hooks** for reusable logic

### File Organization
```
components/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/              # Base UI components (from shadcn/ui)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature-name/    # Feature-specific components
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ component.tsx
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/          # Shared components
```

### Naming Conventions
- **Components**: PascalCase (`TrainsetCard.tsx`)
- **Files**: kebab-case (`trainset-list.tsx`)
- **Functions**: camelCase (`getTrainsetStatus`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`MAX_TRAINSET_COUNT`)

### CSS & Styling
- **Use Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Responsive design** first (mobile-first approach)
- **Consistent spacing** using Tailwind's spacing scale
- **Semantic color usage** (primary, secondary, success, warning, error)

### Example Component Structure
```tsx
"use client"

import { useState } from "react"
import { Card, CardContent, CardHeader, CardTitle } from "@/components/ui/card"
import { Badge } from "@/components/ui/badge"

interface TrainsetCardProps {
  id: string
  number: string
  status: "active" | "maintenance" | "standby" | "out-of-service"
  availability: number
}

export function TrainsetCard({ id, number, status, availability }: TrainsetCardProps) {
  const [isExpanded, setIsExpanded] = useState(false)

  return (
    <Card className="w-full">
      <CardHeader>
        <CardTitle className="flex items-center justify-between">
          <span>{number}</span>
          <Badge variant={getStatusVariant(status)}>
            {status}
          </Badge>
        </CardTitle>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardContent>
        {/* Component content */}
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  )
}

function getStatusVariant(status: string) {
  // Helper function implementation
}
```

## üé® Design Guidelines

### Mobile Responsiveness
- **Mobile-first approach**: Design for mobile, then enhance for desktop
- **Touch-friendly targets**: Minimum 44px touch targets
- **Readable text**: Minimum 16px font size on mobile
- **Appropriate spacing**: Adequate padding and margins for touch

### Accessibility
- **Semantic HTML**: Use proper HTML elements
- **ARIA labels**: Add ARIA labels for screen readers
- **Keyboard navigation**: Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- **Color contrast**: Meet WCAG AA standards

### Component Guidelines
- **Reusable components**: Create modular, reusable components
- **Consistent API**: Similar props patterns across components
- **Error states**: Handle loading and error states gracefully
- **Loading states**: Provide feedback during async operations
